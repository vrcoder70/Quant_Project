## S&P 500 Project Overview

The S&P 500 is the world's most popular stock market index.
Many investment funds are benchmarked to the S&P 500. This means that they seek to replicate the performance of this index by owning all of the stocks that are held in the index.
Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund

### 1.Equal-Weight S&P 500 Index Fund

Introduction

The S&P 500 is the world's most popular stock market index. The largest fund that is benchmarked to this index is the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. It has more than US$250 billion of assets under management.

The goal of this section of the course is to create a Python script that will accept the value of user's portfolio and tell user how many shares of each S&P 500 constituent user should purchase to get an equal-weight version of the index fund.

### 2. Quantitative Momentum Strategy

"Momentum investing" means investing in the stocks that have increased in price the most.

For this project, I am going to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the highest price momentum. From there, I will calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.

### 3. Quantitative Value Strategy

"Value investing" means investing in the stocks that are cheapest relative to common measures of business value (like earnings or assets).

For this project, I am going to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the best value metrics. From there, we will calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.
