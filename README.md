## 3. Quantitative Value Strategy

"Value investing" means investing in the stocks that are cheapest relative to common measures of business value (like earnings or assets).

For this project, I am going to build an investing strategy that selects the 50 stocks with the best value metrics. From there, we will calculate recommended trades for an equal-weight portfolio of these 50 stocks.
